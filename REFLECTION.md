    - My code creates a from with different input types
    - on some input types, like he text ones i implemented a validation to ensure that the input text laigns with what i need it to be

2. What was my coding process?
    - I try to break it down into little parts and work on the issues one by one.

3. What challenges did I have?
    - I cant figure out how to remove the span element after an error

4. What would I do differently now?
    - A lot of the code i used was similar to the one i made for the lab.
